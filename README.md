# Polygon Nightfall Circom circuits test

This is a project to migrate Polygon Nightfall circuits from Zokrates to Circom.
The reasons to do this migration are:
- Circom optimizations (constraints, proof generation time).
- Production ready (Zokrates says in his repo `This is a proof-of-concept implementation. It has not been tested for production.`).
- Test new circom features in the future for optimizations in the project.
